# National Climate Emission Model for Forecasting and Analysis

## Overview

This project develops a machine learning model using an ensemble technique (Stacking) to forecast national climate change emissions, identify trends, and compare emissions across various industries and gases. The primary objective is to provide data-driven insights for informed policymaking and effective management of climate change emissions.

## Project Objectives

*   Develop a machine learning model (specifically, a Stacking Regressor) to accurately forecast future climate change emissions.
*   Identify key trends in emissions across different sectors and gas types.
*   Compare emission levels between various industries to pinpoint major contributing sources and evaluate the impact of regulations.
*   Provide a tool for proactive environmental policy setting, resource allocation, and progress tracking towards sustainability goals.

## Project Structure and Steps

This project follows a standard machine learning pipeline, broken down into the following steps:

### Step 1: Define the Problem

This step clearly outlines the problem being addressed: enabling a nation to effectively understand, predict, and manage its gas emissions contributing to climate change. It also explains the benefits of developing a machine learning model for this purpose, such as informed policymaking, targeted interventions, and effective resource allocation.

### Step 2: Data Collection

This step describes the process of gathering the dataset used for the project. The code in the notebook demonstrates how the data is loaded from a Google Drive file using Python's `requests` and `pandas` libraries.

### Step 3: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

This step involves analyzing the dataset to understand its characteristics, distributions, and relationships. The notebook includes visualizations and analyses to:

*   Visualize the distribution of key categorical variables (`Gas Type` and `Industry`).
*   Compare emissions across different industries and gas types.
*   Identify high-emission areas using a heatmap.

### Step 4: Data Preprocessing

This step prepares the raw data for machine learning model training. The preprocessing steps include:

*   Handling missing values (imputing with the mean for numerical columns).
*   Encoding categorical variables using one-hot encoding.
*   Splitting the data into training and testing sets for model evaluation.

### Step 5: Training Base Models

This step involves training the initial models that will form the basis of the Stacking ensemble. In this project, two base models are trained:

*   **Linear Regression:** A simple linear model to establish a baseline.
*   **Random Forest Regressor:** A powerful tree-based ensemble method known for its ability to capture non-linear relationships.

The performance of these base models is evaluated using metrics like Mean Squared Error (MSE) and R-squared.

### Step 6: Training Meta-Model (Stacking Model)

This is the core of the ensemble technique. A meta-model is trained on the predictions of the base models. The Stacking Regressor combines the strengths of the individual base models to potentially achieve better performance. The notebook trains a Stacking Regressor with a `RidgeCV` as the final estimator. The performance of the Stacking model is also evaluated.

### Step 7: Forecast Future Emissions

This final step utilizes the trained Stacking model to predict future emission levels. The notebook generates future data points based on unique combinations of industries and gas types, preprocesses this future data to match the format expected by the model, and then makes predictions. The forecasted emissions are then visualized by year, industry, and gas type to show potential future trends.

## How to Run the Code

1.  **Open in Google Colab:** The provided code is designed to run in Google Colab. You can directly open your notebook in the Colab environment.
2.  **Connect to a Runtime:** Ensure you are connected to a Colab runtime (GPU or TPU is not strictly necessary for this project but can speed up training on larger datasets).
3.  **Execute Cells:** Run each code cell sequentially from top to bottom. The markdown cells explain the purpose of each section.
4.  **Access Data:** The notebook reads data from a Google Drive URL. Make sure the URL is correct and the file is accessible.

## Dependencies

The project requires the following Python libraries, which are typically pre-installed in Google Colab:

*   `pandas`
*   `numpy`
*   `matplotlib`
*   `seaborn`
*   `sklearn` (scikit-learn)
*   `requests`
*   `io` (built-in)

## Conclusion

This project provides a comprehensive approach to forecasting national climate change emissions using a Stacking ensemble model. The insights gained from this model can be valuable for policymakers and stakeholders in developing effective strategies to mitigate climate change and achieve environmental sustainability.
